# New Tab Page Google Chrome Extension

This is a New Tab Page extension for the Google Chrome web browser.

## Configuration

Currently you must configure your new tab page by editing `newtab.html` to set up your icons. There are some default icons provided in `/img/start-icons/` to get you started. Icons should be transparent PNG images which are  128 pixels wide and 128 pixels tall. There should be some transparent space around the edges of the icon to allow for the shadowed border effect. You can use an existing icon image and edit it in your favorite image editor if you wish to keep your icons all the same size.

## To Do

- Set up a settings page where users can edit the icons without having to modify the code.
